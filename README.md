Lost and Found: The Website V1.2

Currently modified to be rehosted at [lostandfound.stuysu.org](https://lostandfound.stuysu.org)

Originally coded by Alden Sevilla, Noakai Aronesty, and Tomás Acuña, moved to Stuy SU servers and improved on by Chun Yeung "Frank" Wong.

Original README:

**MOBILE-FRIENDLY (ish)!!!!**
<br>Finally made sidebar work such that mobile devices have a much easier time navigating
<br>("Sidebar" is not really a sidebar but it is essentially a nav bar on mobile)

Python database has been coded and tested, and... it works!
Only problem is that we could not find any server that could run the database for free...

Roadmap:
- Add a search function
