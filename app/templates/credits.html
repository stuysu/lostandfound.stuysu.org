            The base code for this website was written by Alden Sevilla, who designed the overall site layout and ui.
            This website would not look nearly as good as it does without the help of Noakai Aronesty, who wrote much of
            the front-end code using bootstrap to design the theming of the website. The website would also not work
            nearly as well as it does without the help of Tomás Acuña, who wrote the backend code to allow the catalogue
            to be updated in real-time.<br>
			Currently, the code has been modified by Chun Yeung Wong to run on the servers and the backend databases of the Stuyvesant Student Union, where it is currently being hosted at.<br>
			The source code is accessible on <a href="https://github.com/frank-cywong/stuylostandfound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github</a>.
            <br><br>Thank you for using the website!
